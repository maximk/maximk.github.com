        <img src="/images/signals1.png">

        <p>
            The signal detector aims at verifying if a time series is predictable with respect to another time series.
            The idea is to make the signal detector sufficiently general and apply it to all available public time
            series even vaguely related to markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The detector is implemented in Julia. It can consume input of almost any Julia data type. This provides for
            rapid testing of a new data source as the the effort of making it compatible with the signal detector is
            relatively small.
        </p>
        <p>
            The signal detection algorithm itself is novel and proprietary.

        <h2 id="bt">A strategy backtesting framework with tick-level accuracy</h2>

        <p>
            The backtesting framework estimates performance of trading strategies as if they run in the past. It serves
            as a gatekeeper preceding strategy deployment. The deployment platform requires for the running strategy to
            have a recent backtesting report. It compares the actual performance of the strategy with the expectations
            from the report.
        </p>
        <p>
            The framework has a few unique features. For example, it can test strategies packaged as microservices in
            the preparation for deployment. This removes any discrepancies between what is being tested and what runs in
            production. For certain strategies trading on the daily cadence, the exectution time may be important. In
            such cases the framework uses tick-level data to pipoint the most likely execution time and price.
        </p>
        <p>
            The backtesting framework is implemented in Go as a series of command-line tools.

        <h2 id="propex">A propensity to exit model of stock markets</h2>

        <p>
            This model of behaviour of market participants assumes that the market moves mostly from
            closing existing positions and the decision to close the position depends on the difference between opening
            and the current price. A trader may decide to exit the position because the profits are high (greed) or
            because the losses are unsustainable (fear). Exiting positions is associated with the sense of urgency. The
            urgency leads to the price impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The propensity to exit model has a compact descrete formulation yet it resisted all attempts at finding
            closed form solutions. Computer simulations have shown that there must exist solutions with prices trending
            at a stready rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The model is a promising approach to understanding the dynamics of markets lacking fundumentals, such as
            cryptocurrencies.

        <h2 id="gmax">A time traveler gain indicator of market volatility</h2>

        <img src="/images/gmax1.png">

        <p>
            In the course of the project I explored a new indicator - a 'time traveler gain'. The indicator calculates
            the maximum gain that can be realized with the perfect knowledge of future prices without a leverage.
        </p>
        <p>
            It happened that the trading costs make calculation of the time traveler gain an NP-complete problem. At the same time an approximate algorithm equipped with a few heuristrics yields near-optimal results.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time traveler gain is yet another indicator of market volatility. It seems more to the point than
            the standard deviation as a measure of volatility.

        <h2 id="fastscore">A microservices-based deployment platform for analytic models</h2>

        <p>
            The platform 'operationalizes' the lifecycle management of analytic models.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have implemented the core components of the initial version of the platform. One of then - the engine -
            could control models written in Python, R, Java, and C. It also allowed uniform access to a range of data
            sources, such as Kafka, Hadoop, S3, etc using a range of data formats.
        </p>

        <p>
            The engine has been implemented in Erlang with bits of other languages. It has been highly-tuned for
            performance. For example, the Avro schema would be compiled into a set of Erlang routines to provide for the
            fastest decoding possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            The engine had full control over the execution flow. It did not use third-party libraries which could start
            new processes, etc. Many data access components were custom-made: a Kafka client, an HDFS client, AWS
            authentication.
        </p>

        <p>
            The initial version of the platform resulted in a series of pilot projects at Fortune 500 companies.

            Membrane targets local interfaces, not networking. A producer and consumer are extended with autogenerated
            adapters. Plugging a producer into a consumer boils down to linking together corresponding object files.
        </p>

        <p>
            Membrane does not introduce a new intermediate format in a contrast to similar mechanisms, such as Protocol
            Buffers. There are no serialization/deserialization steps.
        </p>

        <p>
            Membrane compiler has been implemented in OCaml. The initial version generated adapters for R, Java, and C.

        <h2 id="gale">A SAS-to-PFA compiler</h2>

        <p>
            (PFA is a open format for representation of analytic models based on JSON)
        </p>

        <p>
            The compiler has been developed in the course of a daring project to convert a large SAS model to a
            different format. The SAS model had >10K lines of code and used a substantial subset of the SAS language.
        </p>

        <p>
            The SAS-to-PFA compiler has been implemented in OCaml. The compiler proved to be complete enough to
            translate the target model. The converted model has been producing results identical to the orginal.
        </p>

        <p>
            An interesting feature of the compiler is speculative parsing. The SAS language does not have proper
            keywords. For example, the following is a valid SAS statement:
            <code>
            IF ELSE = 1 THEN ELSE = 2;
            </code>

            The compiler had to explore multiple ways to parse the SAS code to build a valid syntax tree.

        <h2 id="ling">A complete reimplementation of Erlang VM</h2>

        <img src="/images/ling1_1.png">

        <p>
            It is a massive project hard to describe succinctly. The new Erlang VM - called LING - has been implemented
            from scratch. LING is the functional equivalent of the standard Erlang VM (BEAM).
        </p>

        <p>
            LING is a unikernel - it does not require an operating system. It boots directly as a Xen instance.
            Essentially, Erlang processes become OS processes, Erlang drivers become OS drivers, Erlang shell - the OS
            shell.
        </p>

        <p>
            The LING's optimization target is the startup time. I tried hard to shrink the time since the beginning of
            the boot sequence until the application code starts to execute. As a result, it is possible to spin up a
            LING-based Xen instance within 100ms. At the time, a Linux-based Xen instance would take dozens of seconds
            to boot.
        </p>

        <p>
            LING uses a unique approach to specialization of the instruction set of the Erlang VM. The build process
            analyzes a large body of Erlang code to identify widespread instruction variants. For example, if the `load
            x1, 13` instruction happens often, then a new opcode is allocated specifically for loading the value 13 to
            the register x1. Depending on the analyzed Erlang code, the low-level instruction set of Ling could be quite
            different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later, LING has been ported to run on Linux and a baremetal MIPS microcontroller.

        <h2 id="lincx">A fast Erlang-based implementation of an OpenFlow switch</h2>

        <img src="/images/lincx1_1.png">

        <p>
            The OpenFlow softswitch has been implemented in pure Erlang targeting a non-standard Erlang VM (LING). A
            few components have been added to LING in the course of the project. One of them, a netmap driver, allowed
            the Erlang code to talk directly to the network interface bypassing the kernel.
        </p>

        <p>
            OpenFlow rules such as 'forward MPLS packets with QoS set to 3 to port 2' were compiled into Erlang pattern
            matching expressions. The performance of the softswitch has been further enhanced by figuring out the 'fast
            path' and avoiding memory allocations along the path.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a result, the time the packet spent in the switch has been reduced to 1.5&mu;s, the latency hard to
            believe given the dynamic nature of Erlang. The software switch passed all conformance tests for versions
            1.2 and 1.3 of the OpenFlow specification.

            The pipeline has been developed in collaboration with University of Chicago. The goal was to shrink the time

            takes to find starting positions of all known genes within newly-published versions of the human genome.
