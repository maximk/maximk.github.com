        <h2 id="ling">A complete reimplementation of Erlang VM</h2>

        <img src="images/ling1_1.png">

        <p>
            It is a massive project hard to describe succinctly. The new Erlang VM - called LING - has been implemented
            from scratch. LING is the functional equivalent of the standard Erlang VM (BEAM).
        </p>

        <p>
            LING is a unikernel - it does not require an operating system. It boots directly as a Xen instance.
            Essentially, Erlang processes become OS processes, Erlang drivers become OS drivers, Erlang shell - the OS
            shell.
        </p>

        <p>
            The LING's optimization target is the startup time. I tried hard to shrink the time since the beginning of
            the boot sequence until the application code starts to execute. As a result, it is possible to spin up a
            LING-based Xen instance within 100ms. At the time, a Linux-based Xen instance would take dozens of seconds
            to boot.
        </p>

        <p>
            LING uses a unique approach to specialization of the instruction set of the Erlang VM. The build process
            analyzes a large body of Erlang code to identify widespread instruction variants. For example, if the `load
            x1, 13` instruction happens often, then a new opcode is allocated specifically for loading the value 13 to
            the register x1. Depending on the analyzed Erlang code, the low-level instruction set of Ling could be quite
            different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later, LING has been ported to run on Linux and a baremetal MIPS microcontroller.

        <p>
            The platform 'operationalizes' the lifecycle management of analytic models.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have implemented the core components of the initial version of the platform. One of then - the engine -
            could control models written in Python, R, Java, and C. It also allowed uniform access to a range of data
            sources, such as Kafka, Hadoop, S3, etc using a range of data formats.
        </p>

        <p>
            The engine has been implemented in Erlang with bits of other languages. It has been highly-tuned for
            performance. For example, the Avro schema would be compiled into a set of Erlang routines to provide for the
            fastest decoding possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            The engine had full control over the execution flow. It did not use third-party libraries which could start
            new processes, etc. Many data access components were custom-made: a Kafka client, an HDFS client, AWS
            authentication.
        </p>

        <p>
            The initial version of the platform resulted in a series of pilot projects at Fortune 500 companies.

        <h2 id="gale">A SAS-to-PFA compiler</h2>

        <p>
            (PFA is a open format for representation of analytic models based on JSON)
        </p>

        <p>
            The compiler has been developed in the course of a daring project to convert a large SAS model to a
            different format. The SAS model had >10K lines of code and used a substantial subset of the SAS language.
        </p>

        <p>
            The SAS-to-PFA compiler has been implemented in OCaml. The compiler proved to be complete enough to
            translate the target model. The converted model has been producing results identical to the orginal.
        </p>

        <p>
            An interesting feature of the compiler is speculative parsing. The SAS language does not have proper
            keywords. For example, the following is a valid SAS statement:
            <code>
            IF ELSE = 1 THEN ELSE = 2;
            </code>

            The compiler had to explore multiple ways to parse the SAS code to build a valid syntax tree.

        <h2 id="membrane">Membrane - a zero-copy local interface between parts of an ML pipeline</h2>

        <p>
            Membrane is yet another attempt to simplify passing data between ML components written in different
            languages. It focuses on the mathematical meaning of data. For example, a number 3 (three) is treated as
            such regardless of it being represented as an unsigned byte in the producer and as 64-bit IEEE754
            floating-point value in the consumer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Membrane targets local interfaces, not networking. A producer and consumer are extended with autogenerated
            adapters. Plugging a producer into a consumer boils down to linking together corresponding object files.
        </p>

        <p>
            Membrane does not introduce a new intermediate format in a contrast to similar mechanisms, such as Protocol
            Buffers. There are no serialization/deserialization steps.
        </p>

        <p>
            Membrane compiler has been implemented in OCaml. The initial version generated adapters for R, Java, and C.

        <p>
            Deepwater Horizon disaster brought about new safety regulations for companies operating oil rigs. The SaaS
            we developed would allow then to keep all relevant documentation in one place to facilitate audits.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system had 13 modules corresponding to the chapters of the new regulations. For example, the system
            would keep all maintenance records for the equipment installed on oil rigs, inspection reports, documents
            related to incidents and near misses, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The initial version of the system has been implemented in Erlang and deployed to AWS. Only some modules were
            functional. Detailed requirements has been developed for the remaining modules.

            The app has been concieved as a parody. It supposed to show that people do not care much about their
            privacy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system relied on users installing a small utility on their PCs. The utility, written in C/C++, captured
            screenshots every several minutes and published them to the backend written in Erlang. The system has been
            using CouchDB as its data store.
        </p>

        <p>
            There were versions of the local utility for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The screenshots were downsampled
            before the upload to make most texts illegible. Muliple monitor configurations were fully supported.

            The implemented version of the system includes gathering data from multple data providers, training models,
            executing trading strategies, checking limits, and reporting.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system is implemented in Go, Scala, Python, and Julia. It has been deployed to the Google Cloud. The
            system is serverless. There are (almost) no permanent components.
        </p>

        <p>
            It handles terabytes of data and dozens of millions in trading volume.

        <h2 id="lincx">A fast Erlang-based implementation of an OpenFlow switch</h2>

        <img src="images/lincx1_1.png">

        <p>
            The OpenFlow softswitch has been implemented in pure Erlang targeting a non-standard Erlang VM (LING). A
            few components have been added to LING in the course of the project. One of them, a netmap driver, allowed
            the Erlang code to talk directly to the network interface bypassing the kernel.
        </p>

        <p>
            OpenFlow rules such as 'forward MPLS packets with QoS set to 3 to port 2' were compiled into Erlang pattern
            matching expressions. The performance of the softswitch has been further enhanced by figuring out the 'fast
            path' and avoiding memory allocations along the path.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a result, the time the packet spent in the switch has been reduced to 1.5&mu;s, the latency hard to
            believe given the dynamic nature of Erlang. The software switch passed all conformance tests for versions
            1.2 and 1.3 of the OpenFlow specification.

        <image src="images/board1.png" />

        <p>
            The interactive board setup included a projector fitted with a camera and a special stylus. A software
            driver converted the video feed captured by the camera into the precise position of the stylus.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interactive boards based on visual processing were new at the time. Later, many such boards appeared.
            The unique feature of my implementation is that I did not place the light-emitting element in the tip of the
            stylus where it could get obscured by the hand holding the stylus. In my setup the entire stylus was glowing
            in infrared and a special algorithm was able to figure out the position of the tip of the stylus from
            the captured images of the glow. The algorithm provided for 1mm resolution which was state of the art.
        </p>

        <p>
            The software component of the interactive board has been implemented in C/C++ using the OpenCV library.

        <h2 id="align">A gene alignment pipeline for the Humane Genome project</h2>

        <p>
            The pipeline has been developed in collaboration with University of Chicago. The goal was to shrink the time
            it
            takes to find starting positions of all known genes within newly-published versions of the human genome.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have explored multiple approaches to fuzzy matching trying to surpass the performance of widely used
            libraries/algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
            The pipeline has been implemented in Erlang in the attempt to harness its distributed mode and pattern
            matching.
        </p>

        <p>
            I helped with the design of alignment algorithms and the performance tuning of the Erlang code.
